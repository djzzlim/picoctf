# [WebDecode](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/427)

## Challenge Information

- **Category**: Web Exploitation
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Description**: Do you know how to use the web inspector? Start searching here to find the flag.

## Solution Overview

This challenge tests basic web inspection skills and knowledge of common encoding techniques. The flag is hidden in the HTML source code as a Base64 encoded string within a custom HTML attribute. By examining the page source and decoding the string, we can retrieve the flag.

## Hints

- Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page.
- The flag may or may not be encoded.

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 1: Initial Inspection

Upon accessing the challenge website, we're presented with a simple webpage with minimal content. The visible text hints directly at what we need to do:

```
Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there
```

This is a clear indication that we need to examine the page's source code.

### Step 2: Examining the Source Code

To view the source code, we can use the browser's built-in developer tools (typically accessible via right-click and selecting "View Page Source" or pressing Ctrl+U).

Looking at the HTML source of the page, we find an interesting custom attribute in the "about" section element:

```html
<section class="about" notify_true="cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMWY4MzI2MTV9">
  <h1> Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there </h1>
  <!-- .about-container -->
</section>
```

The `notify_true` attribute contains what appears to be an encoded string: `cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMWY4MzI2MTV9`

### Step 3: Decoding the String

The encoded string has the characteristics of Base64 encoding:
- Contains only alphanumeric characters plus `+` and `/`
- Length is a multiple of 4 characters (or padded with `=` to make it so)
- Mix of upper and lowercase letters

To decode this Base64 string, we can use any Base64 decoder tool:
- Online decoder websites
- Command line tools like `base64` on Linux/macOS
- Browser console with `atob()` function

Using the browser console with the `atob()` function:
```javascript
atob("cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMWY4MzI2MTV9")
```

Or using the `base64` command in a terminal:
```bash
echo "cGljb0NURnt3ZWJfc3VjYzNzc2Z1bGx5X2QzYzBkZWRfMWY4MzI2MTV9" | base64 -d
```

Both methods reveal the decoded string: `picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_1f832615}`

## Flag

```
picoCTF{web_succ3ssfully_d3c0ded_1f832615}
```

## Learning Points

- **HTML Inspection**: Web browsers provide tools for inspecting HTML source code, which is crucial for web security testing.
- **Custom Attributes**: Developers can add arbitrary attributes to HTML elements, which might contain hidden information.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Base64 is a common encoding scheme used to represent binary data in an ASCII string format.
- **Web Inspector Usage**: The challenge reinforces the importance of using web inspector tools for security analysis.

## Mitigation Strategies

To prevent sensitive information exposure in web applications:

- **Don't store secrets in client-side code**: Anything in HTML, JavaScript, or CSS can be viewed by users.
- **Implement proper authentication**: Use server-side validation and authentication mechanisms.
- **Use secure storage**: Store sensitive information in secure cookies or server-side sessions.
