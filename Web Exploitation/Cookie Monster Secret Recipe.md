# [Cookie Monster Secret Recipe](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/469)

## Challenge Information

- **Category**: Web Exploitation
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Description**: Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?
- **Instance-based Challenge**: The challenge provides a running web instance that must be explored.

## Solution Overview

The challenge revolves around **manipulating cookies** in the browser to extract hidden data. Specifically, we need to examine the cookies stored by the web application to uncover the secret recipe.

## Hints

1. **Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.**
2. **Have you checked your cookies lately?**

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 1: Accessing the Website

Upon visiting the challenge URL (`http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:49480/`), we are presented with a login page.

Trying random credentials like:
```
Username: cookies
Password: cookies
```
results in an **Access Denied** message:
```
Access Denied
Cookie Monster says: 'Me no need password. Me just need cookies!'
Hint: Have you checked your cookies lately?
```

### Step 2: Inspecting Browser Cookies

1. Open **Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click -> Inspect Element).
2. Navigate to the **Application** tab and locate the **Cookies** section.
3. The site has a cookie named `secret_recipe` with the following value:
   ```
   secret_recipe=cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ%3D%3D
   ```
   This appears to be base64-encoded, but the `=` symbols are encoded in HTML as `%3D%3D`.

### Step 3: Decoding the Cookie

The cookie value appears to be **Base64 encoded**. Using a decoder, we can extract the plaintext value:

```bash
$ echo 'cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0FDOEZDRDc1fQ==' | base64 -d
picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_AC8FCD75}
```

This reveals the **flag** for the challenge.

## Tools and Resources Used

- **Browser Developer Tools**: To inspect and extract cookies.
- **Base64 Decoder**: To decode the cookie value.

## Flag

```
picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_AC8FCD75}
```

## Learning Points

- **Understanding how web applications use cookies to store information.**
- **Using browser developer tools to inspect and manipulate web data.**
- **Recognizing and decoding Base64-encoded data.**

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Do not store sensitive information in client-side cookies.**
- **Use secure, HttpOnly, and encrypted cookies for authentication.**
- **Validate and restrict cookie values to prevent exposure of secrets.**
