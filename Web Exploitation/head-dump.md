# [head-dump](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/476)

## Challenge Information

- **Category**: Web Exploitation
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Description**: Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag.

## Solution Overview

The challenge involves exploring a web application for **hidden endpoints** that expose sensitive information. Specifically, we are looking for an API or file that dumps server memory, which may contain the flag.

## Hints

- **Explore backend development with us.**
- **The head was dumped.**

## Detailed Walkthrough

### Step 1: Exploring the Web Application

Upon visiting the provided challenge URL, we view the website's source code and notice the following link:
- `<a href="/api-docs" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">#API Documentation</a>`

This link leads to the API documentation. One particularly interesting endpoint listed in the documentation is `/heapdump`, which can be used to diagnose memory allocation. Visiting `/heapdump` triggers the download of a heap snapshot file.

### Step 2: Extracting the Flag

After downloading the heap snapshot file, we can search for `picoCTF{` directly using the `cat` command with `grep`:

```bash
cat heapdump-XXXXXXX.heapsnapshot | grep "picoCTF{"
```

This reveals the flag embedded in the memory dump.

## Tools and Resources Used

- **Browser Developer Tools**: To analyze API requests.
- **Command-line tools (cat, grep)**: To extract the flag from the heap dump.

## Flag

```
picoCTF{Pat!3nt_15_Th3_K3y_bed6b6b8}
```

## Learning Points

- **Exploring web application endpoints through API documentation.**
- **Extracting sensitive information from memory dumps.**

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Disable public access to debugging/memory dump files.**
- **Ensure sensitive files are not exposed through API endpoints.**
- **Implement proper access control for server files.**
